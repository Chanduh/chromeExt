        <p>This is a popup! Not sure what it should say yet. It could say that the purpose of this extension is to remind you 
            to <strong>FOCUS</strong> instead of falling down a hole of mindless entertainment. <BR><BR>You have this installed 
            because you aim to be productive, like me. Perhaphs you could install it when you are trying to 
            build your first Chrome extension, like me. Like this one. Right now.</p>
